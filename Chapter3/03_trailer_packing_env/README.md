# üöõ 3D Trailer Loading Environment

**Author**: Hadi Aghazadeh  
**Publisher**: Manning Publications  
**Book**: "Reinforcement Learning for Business"  
**Chapter**: 3 - Advanced Environment Design

## üì¶ Overview

A **3D container packing environment** that simulates real-world trailer loading challenges. This environment teaches agents to intelligently pack items into multiple containers while maximizing space utilization and ensuring stable loading patterns.

Perfect for learning about **spatial reasoning**, **logistics optimization**, and **3D constraint satisfaction** in business applications.

### üéØ Business Context

**Real-World Applications:**
- **Logistics**: Optimize trailer and container loading for shipping companies
- **Warehousing**: Maximize storage efficiency in distribution centers  
- **Transportation**: Improve load stability and space utilization
- **Supply Chain**: Reduce shipping costs through intelligent packing

## üéÆ How It Works

### **Environment Mechanics**
- **Multiple Containers**: Different trailer types with varying dimensions
- **3D Item Placement**: Items can be positioned anywhere in (x, y, z) coordinates
- **Orientation Control**: Each item can be rotated in 6 different ways
- **Physics Validation**: Prevents overlapping and ensures stable placement
- **Support Requirements**: Items need adequate support underneath for realistic loading

### **Key Features**
- **Smart Placement Scoring**: Rewards corner placement, wall contact, and stability
- **Visual 3D Rendering**: Professional trailer-style visualization with filled cuboids
- **Multiple Item Types**: Various box sizes with different colors and properties
- **Performance Metrics**: Track volume utilization, efficiency, and success rates

### **Agent Intelligence Levels**
- **Random Agent**: Chaotic placement with poor space utilization
- **Heuristic Agent**: Intelligent placement using support, corners, and gap minimization
- **Custom Agents**: Build your own strategies for optimal packing

## üéõÔ∏è Easy Customization

### **Container Types**
Modify `TRAILER_SCHEMAS` to test different container sizes:
```python
TRAILER_SCHEMAS = [
    {'id': 'Container_A', 'dims': (8, 6, 5)},     # Standard
    {'id': 'Container_B', 'dims': (6, 6, 6)},     # Cube
    {'id': 'Container_C', 'dims': (10, 4, 4)},    # Long
]
```

### **Item Varieties**
Customize `ITEM_DEFINITIONS` for different packing scenarios:
```python
ITEM_DEFINITIONS = [
    {'id': 1, 'name': 'SmallBox', 'dims': (2, 2, 1), 'color': (1, 0, 0, 0.8)},
    {'id': 2, 'name': 'MedBox', 'dims': (3, 2, 2), 'color': (0, 1, 0, 0.8)},
    {'id': 3, 'name': 'LongBox', 'dims': (4, 1, 1), 'color': (0, 0, 1, 0.8)},
]
```

### **Loading Sequence**
Change `ITEM_SEQUENCE` to test different packing challenges:
```python
ITEM_SEQUENCE = ['SmallBox', 'MedBox', 'LongBox', 'SmallBox', 'MedBox']
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### **1. Run the Environment**
```python
# Basic usage
python 03_trailer_loading_env.py
```

### **2. Test Different Strategies**
```python
# Open the evolution notebook
trailer_loading_evolution_simple.ipynb
```

### **3. Customize Your Scenario**
```python
# Edit the configurations at the top of the files:
CONTAINER_SCHEMAS = [...]  # Your container types
ITEM_DEFINITIONS = [...]   # Your item types  
ITEM_SEQUENCE = [...]      # Your packing sequence
```
