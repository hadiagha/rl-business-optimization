# üí∞ Perishable product dynamic pricing environment

Imagine a perishable goods business where every pricing decision impacts your bottom line. You have limited time to sell your inventory before it expires, customer demand fluctuates with price changes, and unsold items become costly losses. This project demonstrates how intelligent pricing strategies emerge from simple business rules, showcasing the evolution from random pricing chaos to systematic revenue optimization.

## üìñ The Business Story

In today's competitive marketplace, pricing isn't just about covering costs‚Äîit's about maximizing revenue while managing inventory risk. Our dynamic pricing environment simulates the real-world challenge faced by businesses selling time-sensitive products: airlines with seats, hotels with rooms, retailers with perishable goods, or e-commerce platforms with limited-time offers.

This project brings that challenge to life through three interconnected components that demonstrate how artificial intelligence can transform business decision-making:

## üè™ **The Core: Dynamic Pricing Environment** (`02_dynamic_pricing_env.py`)
*The complete business simulation where pricing intelligence emerges*

### What Makes This Environment Special

Our dynamic pricing environment is a fully-featured business simulation that captures the complexity of real-world pricing decisions:

**üåç Rich Business Dynamics**
- **Time-constrained selling periods** with clear deadlines
- **Inventory management** with limited stock that decreases with sales
- **Price-sensitive demand** where customers respond to price changes
- **Stochastic market behavior** with realistic demand fluctuations
- **Real-time business visualization** showing performance metrics

**‚öñÔ∏è Sophisticated Business Incentives**
The environment teaches optimal pricing through realistic business pressures:
- **Revenue generation**: Price √ó Quantity sold creates income
- **Time pressure**: Limited selling periods create urgency
- **Demand sensitivity**: Higher prices reduce customer demand
- **Inventory risk**: Unsold items incur penalty costs at episode end
- **Market dynamics**: Demand can increase as time pressure builds (urgency factor)

**üîÑ Complete Business Cycle Management**
- **Episode structure**: Full selling seasons with clear start and end
- **State tracking**: Time remaining, inventory levels, pricing history
- **Performance metrics**: Revenue, sales volume, inventory turnover
- **Historical analysis**: Complete transaction history for strategy analysis

**üé® Executive Dashboard**
- **Real-time analytics** with matplotlib integration
- **Multi-panel displays**: Inventory, pricing, sales, and revenue trends
- **Color-coded performance**: Visual indicators of business health
- **Time-series analysis**: Historical performance tracking
- **Interactive controls**: Adjustable visualization speed and detail

### Business Architecture

```python
class DynamicPricingEnv:
    """
    Complete business simulation featuring:
    - Time-constrained selling periods
    - Price-sensitive customer demand
    - Inventory management with penalties
    - Real-time business analytics
    - Configurable market parameters
    """
```

The environment operates on a realistic business cycle:
1. **Selling Phase**: Business has limited time to sell inventory
2. **Demand Response**: Customers react to pricing decisions  
3. **Revenue Generation**: Sales create income, unsold items create costs
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Success measured by total profit

### Key Business Features Deep Dive

**Demand Modeling**: The environment implements sophisticated demand curves where customer behavior responds realistically to price changes, including urgency effects as deadlines approach and stochastic market variations.

**Inventory Management**: Real-time inventory tracking with automatic deduction for sales, preventing overselling while maintaining accurate stock levels throughout the selling period.

**Penalty Structure**: Unsold inventory incurs realistic costs at episode end, creating authentic business pressure to balance revenue maximization with inventory clearance.

**Market Dynamics**: Advanced demand modeling includes urgency factors (customers more willing to buy as time runs out) and random market fluctuations that mirror real-world uncertainty.

## üß™ **Validation Layer: Business Logic Tests** (`test_dynamic_pricing_integration.py`)
*Ensuring our business simulation operates flawlessly*

Before deploying pricing strategies in our environment, we must validate that every business rule works correctly. Our comprehensive test suite validates all aspects of the pricing environment:

### What Gets Tested

**üîç Business Logic Validation**
- **Pricing mechanism**: Actions correctly map to price levels
- **Revenue calculation**: Sales properly generate income (price √ó quantity)
- **Inventory management**: Stock levels decrease accurately with sales
- **Time progression**: Business periods advance correctly

**üì¶ Market Behavior Verification**
- **Demand sensitivity**: Higher prices generate lower demand
- **Market response**: Customer behavior reacts appropriately to pricing
- **Sales execution**: Transactions process correctly within inventory limits
- **Episode termination**: Business cycles end at appropriate times

**üéØ Financial System Accuracy**
- **Revenue tracking**: Income calculations match sales reality
- **Penalty application**: Unsold inventory costs applied correctly
- **Performance metrics**: Business KPIs calculated accurately
- **State consistency**: Financial data remains internally consistent

**üîÑ Edge Case Handling**
- **Inventory depletion**: Sold-out scenarios handled properly
- **Invalid pricing**: Out-of-range price selections rejected appropriately
- **Time expiration**: Episode ending triggers correct final calculations
- **Visualization data**: Historical tracking maintains data integrity

### Testing Philosophy

Our tests follow the principle of **business reality verification**: rather than testing internal code mechanics, we verify that the environment behaves like a real business from the decision-maker's perspective. This ensures our environment provides a reliable foundation for strategy development and comparison.

```python
def test_revenue_calculation():
    """Verify revenue equals price √ó quantity sold"""
    
def test_demand_price_sensitivity():
    """Confirm lower prices generate higher demand"""
    
def test_unsold_penalty_application():
    """Validate inventory costs applied at episode end"""
```

## üéØ **Strategy Demonstration: Evolution Showcase** (`pricing_evolution_simple.ipynb`)
*Where business intelligence proves its worth*

With our environment validated and ready, the notebook demonstrates its power by showcasing the dramatic difference between random and intelligent pricing strategies.

### The Business Strategy Comparison

The notebook implements two fundamentally different approaches to the same business challenge:

**üé≤ Random Agent: Business Chaos**
```python
class RandomAgent:
    def choose_action(self, state, price_levels):
        return np.random.randint(0, len(price_levels))  # Pure randomness
```
- Represents zero business intelligence - random price selection
- No consideration of market conditions or time pressure
- Inconsistent performance with high variance
- Provides baseline for measuring strategic improvement

**üß† Heuristic Agent: Business Intelligence**
```python
class HeuristicAgent:
    def choose_action(self, state, price_levels):
        # Time-based pricing strategy
        # Early periods: premium pricing
        # Late periods: clearance pricing
```
- Implements strategic time-sensitive pricing
- Starts with premium prices when time is abundant
- Gradually reduces prices as deadline approaches
- Balances revenue maximization with inventory clearance

### What the Business Demonstration Reveals

**üìä Performance Metrics**
- **Revenue Generation**: Heuristic significantly outperforms random pricing
- **Inventory Management**: Strategic pricing reduces unsold stock
- **Consistency**: Heuristic delivers predictable business outcomes

**üé® Strategic Evidence**
